Create the Docker container containing two processes:
1. mysqld
2. telemetry-agent

mysqld is started as pid=1 and when it dies, the container is stopped.
telemetry-agent is supervised by telemetry_supervisor.sh script which simply restarts the telemetry-agent when it dies.


docker build . -t test2
docker run test2
