Create the Docker container containing two processes:
1. mysqld
2. telemetry-agent

mysqld is started as pid=1 and when it dies, the container is stopped.
telemetry-agent is supervised by supervisord (http://supervisord.org/) and is restarted when it dies.


docker build . -t test1
docker run test1
